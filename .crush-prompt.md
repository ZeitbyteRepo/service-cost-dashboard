You are Hephaestus. Read docs/IDENTITY-heph.md first. Then read the research dispatch at docs/fromResearch/2026-02-27-billing-usage-api-research.md

Your task: Build the multi-provider cost dashboard based on the research.

Phase 1: Create the provider registry
- Create src/lib/providers/registry.ts with all 13 providers
- Each provider has: id, name, category, apiKey env var, fetch function

Phase 2: Create unified data model
- src/lib/providers/types.ts with ProviderData interface
- Standard fields: id, name, category, costs (current/previous/trend), usage, health, lastUpdated

Phase 3: Build API routes for each provider
- Start with Railway (already works)
- Then add: OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, LemonSqueezy, ElevenLabs, GitHub
- Skip dashboard-only providers for now (Groq, Google, Supabase, HuggingFace, Brave, DeepSeek)

Phase 4: Create unified dashboard API
- /api/providers - returns all provider data in one call
- 15-minute caching with manual refresh option

Phase 5: Update the UI to show all providers
- Card grid layout
- Each card shows: provider name, cost, usage, health
- Click to expand details

Commit and push after each phase. Run 'npm run build' to verify before committing.

Say 'DONE' when complete.
